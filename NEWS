Version 0.4.0

- The vcov() method for aggregate indexes now returns a matrix of variances instead of an array of covariances, as the covariances are usually misleading. In most cases elemental aggregates are sampled independently, in which case the covariances are 0. 

- The vcov() method for aggregate indexes is now much faster, and the options for parallel computing have been removed.

- Added an as.matrix() method for 'pias' objects. This makes it easy to aggregate a price index as a matrix operation; just matrix multiply the aggregation matrix with the elemental indexes.

- Added an as.data.frame() method for 'pias' objects. This is useful for writing price-updated weights with, e.g., write.csv().

- Added an as_index() method for data frames. This is faster and simpler than turning a data frame into an index with elemental_index(df$value, df$period, df$level).

- The 'chain' argument found in some of the methods for elemental_index() and as_index() to mark an index as chainable has been replaced by the more desriptive 'chainable' argument. Partial matching of argument names means this is backwards compatible. The is_chain_index() function is now deprecated, and replaced with the is_chainable_index() function.
