# piar: Price Index Aggregation

Most price indexes are made with a two-step procedure, where
period-over-period elementary indexes are first calculated for a
collection of elementary aggregates at each point in time, and then
aggregated according to a price index aggregation structure. These
indexes can then be chained together to form a time series that gives
the evolution of prices with respect to a fixed base period. This
package contains a collection of functions that revolve around this work
flow, making it easy to build standard price indexes, and implement the
methods described by Balk (2008,
[doi:10.1017/CBO9780511720758](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511720758)
), von der Lippe (2007,
[doi:10.3726/978-3-653-01120-3](https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-653-01120-3)
), and the CPI manual (2020,
[doi:10.5089/9781484354841.069](https://doi.org/10.5089/9781484354841.069)
) for bilateral price indexes.
