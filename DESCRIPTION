Description: Most price indexes are made with a two-step procedure, where
    period-over-period elemental indexes are first calculated for a collection
    of elemental aggregates at each point in time, and then aggregated according
    to a price index aggregation structure. These indexes can then be chained
    together to form a time series that gives the evolution of prices with
    respect to a fixed base period. This package contains a collection of
    functions that revolve around this work flow, making it easy to build
    standard price indexes, and implement the methods described by
    Balk (2008, <doi:10.1017/CBO9780511720758>), von der Lippe (2007,
    <doi:10.3726/978-3-653-01120-3>), and the CPI manual (2020,
    <doi:10.5089/9781484354841.069>) for bilateral price indexes.
