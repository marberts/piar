Description: Most price indexes are made with a two-step procedure, where period-over-period elemental indexes are first calculated for a collection of elemental aggregates at each point in time, and then aggregated according to a price index aggregation structure. These indexes can then be chained together to form a time series that gives the evolution of prices with respect to a fixed base period. This package contains a collections of functions that revolve around this work flow, making it easy to build standard price indexes, and implement the methods described by Balk (2008, ISBN:978-1-107-40496-0), von der Lippe (2001, ISBN:3-8246-0638-0), and the CPI manual (2020, ISBN:978-1-51354-298-0) for bilateral price indexes.
